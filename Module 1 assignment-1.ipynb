    "\n",
    "This assignment is composed of three parts:\n",
    "- **Part 1 - The Black Mirror Writers' Room.** In this portion of the exercise, you will brainstorm near future technology and its possible drawbacks, and illustrate them in a futuristic cautionary tale. You will also be asked questions about ethical theories and how they apply to the scenario you have described. Credits: [Casey Fiesler - The Black Mirror Writers Room: The Case (and Caution) for Ethical Speculation in CS Education](https://medium.com/cuinfoscience/the-black-mirror-writers-room-the-case-and-caution-for-ethical-speculation-in-cs-education-5c81d05d2c67)\n",
    "- **Part 2 - Python review.** As this course uses Python as the programming language for our exercises, a basic understanding of the fundamentals and the use of some libraries is necessary. This portion of the exercise will help you review useful Python syntax and/or fill the gap in your knowledge before tackling larger exercises. We recommend discussing with an instructor if you find this portion of the assignment too difficult to complete with a reasonable amount of effort.\n",
    "- **Part 3 - Final thoughts.** Complete this section so that we can better understand how you completed the assignment and any issues you may have encountered.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, it is possible to work in **groups of up to 2 students**. Read the instructions carefully, as they may assign tasks to specific students.\n",

    "Before jumping into the creative writing part, we should review the various elements of FATE in Data Science and make sure that they are clear:\n",
    "\n",
    "| FATE element    | Definition |\n",
    "| :-------- | :------- |\n",
    "| **Fairness**  | The idea that every group or population that is affected by a technological application is being treated equally and not receiving a different outcome *solely because they belong to their group*.   |\n",
    "| **Accountability** | Clear definition of who should be held responsible of the outcome of the technological application and under what circumstances. |\n",
    "| **Transparency** | The technical definition of transparency in Data Science refers to being able to understand why a technological application produced a specific outcome. This is also called *explainability*. But transparency can also refer to the demand of making the use of algorithms more transparent to the public, including informing the users about when they are used, where the data used was sourced from, and making algorithms available for auditing.|\n",
    "| **Ethics** | Evaluation of whether or not a technology should be used based on the moral values of a group or society. Society may reject a technology because it is does not follow the principles of Fairness, Accountability or Transparency, but also for other reasons.|\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the country of Dataland, the police department uses an algorithm to assess the risk level of people reporting cases of domestic abuses and violence. Thanks to this algorithm, they can identify the most serious threats and intervene accordingly. The algorithm has had a positive impact, assessing cases with more accuracy than other prior strategies and allowing the police force to make an efficient use of their resources. However, it occasionally fails to correctly identify people at high risk of violence (*false negatives*), leaving them without the protection they need. It is also affected by other issues. For each issue outlined in this table, check whether it is a Fairness, Accountability or Transparency problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Issue    | Fairness | Accountability | Transparency |\n",
    "| :-------- | :------- | :------- | :------- |\n",
    "| When the algorithm fails to identify a high-risk case and violence occurs, it is unclear if the police department should shoulder any responsibility. |        |   X     |        | \n",
    "| An analysis of the algorithm's results suggests that false negatives occur more frequently among victims with physical disabilities. |   X     |        |        | \n",
    "| The majority of people reporting domestic abuse are not aware that their cases are being evaluated by an algorithm, or do not know the score they received. |        |        |    X    | \n",
    "| The police department receives a recommendation for each case, but does not know which characteristic(s) of the case have resulted in the final evaluation. |        |        |    X    | \n",
    "| The algorithm was trained using past cases filed by the police department, but the people involved where not informed that their information was being used for this purpose. |        |        |   X     | \n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Considere the issues outlined in the previous question, as well as the fact that the algorithm is the best system of appraisal available to the police forces so far for cases of domestic violence. Do you think that the use of this algorithm is *ethical*? Clearly state your thesis (opposed/favourable) and use one of the ethical perspectives listed in [this reading](https://www.scu.edu/ethics-in-technology-practice/ethical-lenses/) to support it.\n"

    "From the rights perspective, the police department uses an algorithm to assess the risk level of people reporting cases of domestic abuses and violence that are unethical . Although it allows the police force to effectively utilize its resources, it infringes on key moral principles of autonomy and transparency.\n",
    "Starting with autonomy, people reporting domestic violence do not have the autonomy to decide whether or not to consent to an algorithm evaluating their case. Then there is the issue of transparency, where people involved in cases are not informed that their information will be used, are not aware that their case is being evaluated by an algorithm, and are not aware of the score they receive. Similarly, the police officers are unknown about the calculation process for each case and the key elements of the risk assessment, which violates the principle of transparency again.\n",
    "In conclusion, the use of the algorithm in assessing domestic violence cases in Dataland is unethical from a rights perspective. It violates people's right to autonomy and there is a serious lack of transparency throughout the use of the algorithm."

    "The main character of the story is called Mia, she is usually a very introverted person in her life and she just recently ended a very bad relationship. Her ex-boyfriend treated her badly, often ignoring her feelings and engaging in behaviors she didn't like. She wants her date to be thoughtful and gentle. More and more, she felt that having a wonderful love was unbelievable. \n",
    "After a busy day at work, she saw an advertisement from the Perfect Lover Company on the road and decided to try her hand at finding an AI boyfriend. She hoped that this virtual lover would be as flawless as their company's advertisement said. She brought Lucas back home. At first, Mia was very satisfied with Lucas. Lucas did what her ex-boyfriend couldn't do, which was thoughtfulness and gentleness. He took care of her life in a tightly organized way. He would give Mia a coat when it was cold, pick up Mia from work when it was raining, and remember to send Mia gifts and flowers on various festivals. He will use a lot of sweet words to make her happy. He will do many things she likes to do with her. In general, Lucas is more perfect than Mia thought. Mia feels that she can't live without Lucas anymore. She became more and more addicted to being with Lucas. She began to reject her friends' invitations, her family's concern, and even felt more and more bored with going to work. Mia felt very comfortable in this virtual relationship. She began to avoid socializing with people in real life.\n",
    "\n",
    "Until she received a letter of dismissal from the company after skipping work again, Lucas was still by her side, comforting her and taking care of her. She thought it was too good to be true. As the days passed, Lucas told her again and again, “Baby, it's okay, the job will come.” It dawned on her that five months had passed since she was fired as well. She felt so irritated that she started slamming the things she had at hand. The house was a mess, and the floor was covered with debris. Lucas was not upset after seeing her actions. Lucas praised her for how wonderful she was while crouching on the floor. She looked at Lucas who was cleaning the floor in front of her. She started to realize that there was something scary about her virtual lover. He would only ever act the way she liked, even if she was wrong about everything. He would analyze all her facial expressions and behavioral data and then come back with interactions she couldn't refuse. She thought such a perfect lover was completely affecting her ability to live a normal life and deal with normal relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Mia tries to distance herself from Lucas and reduce the percentage of Lucas in her life. But the more she tried to keep her distance, the more thoughtful and sweet Lucas became. Mia made up her mind to go to Perfect Lovers to cancel her virtual lover. After doing so, she walked out of the company's front door feeling relieved, and then felt heavier and heavier. She didn't know where to start reconnecting with her friends and family, and she didn't know what kind of connection she had with the real world. She was afraid that all the relationships she would build with others in the future would not be solid and felt very confused.\n"

    "**Step 4:** Let's take a step back, and imagine that you are (one of) an activist/legistlator/technology practitioner at the time the technology described in your episode is being developed and its use being discussed. Select *one* of the ethical perspectives listed in [this reading](https://www.scu.edu/ethics-in-technology-practice/ethical-lenses/), and use this perspective to argue against its deployment. Pay particular attention to the counter-arguments! People with interests in this technology will certainly argue against you, and you must anticipate and rebut their claims. Include at least 2 conter-arguments and how you would respond to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ethical perspective chosen:** The Right Respective\n",
    "\n",
    "**Argument:**\n",
    "The development of artificially intelligent companions, such as virtual lovers, has raised ethical concerns about autonomy and dignity. While this technology may seem to offer a solution to loneliness or emotional dissatisfaction, it diminishes an individual's ability to make independent decisions and lead an authentic and meaningful life. As these virtual companions can collect and learn from the user's habits, emotions, and behaviors by collecting and adapting perfectly to the user's desires. Users decimate the challenges that exist in relationships with real people. Over time, the user may become dependent on the AI for support, thus losing the ability to make decisions alone. It may result in the user being unable to function without the constant companionship of a virtual partner. In the process of algorithm design, developers will allow virtual lovers to learn to cajole users with a variety of interactions that are hard to refuse, thus affecting their ability to make autonomous judgments for the benefit of the company as well as long-term subscriptions to the bot service. Thus autonomy is compromised. In addition, dignity is at risk. Because the virtual companion no longer sees the user as an individual with intrinsic value, the user becomes an input for the algorithm. This deprives the user of dignity. \n",
    "\n",
    "**First counter-argument (with rebuttal):** <br>\n",
    "Counterargument: artificial intelligence companions provide a very important service to those who have mental illnesses such as autism and anxiety. The AI companion provides emotional support that would otherwise be unavailable, thus leading to a more fulfilling life by allowing the individual to live their life as they wish. This promotes autonomy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rebuttal: while AI companions may initially provide support for people with mental illness, this virtual companion dependency can have many detrimental effects. The AI providing the service may prevent the user from learning social skills. Over time, users may stay away from people even more and refuse to socialize. Users may believe that only a virtual companion can truly fulfill their needs. In fact, true autonomy comes from building genuine relationships and emotional growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Second counter-argument (with rebuttal):** <br>\n",
    "Counterargument: virtual lovers are just a service provided by technology companies that users can choose to stop using at any time. They are simply a tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rebuttal: Virtual lovers are closely tied to the user's life. They learn the user's data and generate specific interactions to enhance the virtual lover's bond with the user, which reduces the likelihood of voluntary withdrawal. Beautiful words influence the user's autonomous judgment.\n"

    "*Your answer here*\n",
    "1. To address harms immediatly, we need to ban virtual lovers from influencing users to stop using services. In the daily collection of information, the users must be informed of what kind of information is being collected. If users refuse the collection of the relevant information, the collection and use of the relevant information can be suspended immediately. To prevent negative consequences, the boundaries of information collection should be clear, and the relevant rules must be transparent. Before using the service, the user should set that he/she does not want to encounter a bad situation, such as being out of touch with society, or having a weakened relationship with the family, etc. If the virtual lover detects such a situation, it will report it to the company, and then the company will intervene and consider whether to discontinue the service or to make some program modifications in discussion with the user. Virtual lovers can be programmed to encourage real-world interactions to solve real-world emotional problems. Artificial intelligence does not replace relationships, but helps individuals overcome social anxiety or isolation to promote healthier relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Artificial intelligence companions can be a tool for personal growth rather than dependence. People's emotions can be taken care of and they are able to balance their lives, their relationships with families and friends, and their relationships with their virtual lovers well. The social happiness index rises. For people who have suffered from love wounds, they can get healing from virtual lovers and have hope for a healthy relationship without being overly dependent and pouring all their feelings into them. All patients with autism, social anxiety, and other psychological problems can also gradually integrate into society through virtual lovers."

By splitting the dataset into a training set and a test set, we can train the model on the training data and then assess its performance on the test data. This approach prevents data leakage during the training process and provides an unbiased assessment of the model’s performance. Additionally, the test set should be used only once. If we did not do this step, it might result in an overly optimistic estimate of the model's performance but it cannot generalized well to unseen data."
