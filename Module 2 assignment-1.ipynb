    "In class, we discussed different sources of bias that can affect the data we want to use for our Data Science applications. Here is a summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Historical bias\n",
    "**Historical bias:** bias that exists in society and is reflected in the data. It is the most insidious because it arises even if we are able to perfectly sample from the existing population. Most often, it affects groups that are historically disadvantaged.\n",
    "\n",
    "E.g. In 2018, 5% of Fortune 500 CEOs were women. Historically, women have less frequently made it to a CEO position. A classifier trained to predict the best choice for a new CEO may learn this pattern and determine that being a woman makes one less qualified to be a CEO.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Representation bias\n",
    "**Representation bias:** the sample underrepresents part(s) of the population and fails to generalize well. This may happen for different reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The sampling methods only reached a portion of the population. E.g. Data collected via smartphone apps can under-represent lower incomes or older groups, who may be less likely to own smartphones.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The population of interest has changed or is distinct from the sample used during model training. E.g. Data that is representative of Vancouver may not be representative if used to analyze the population in Toronto. Similarly, data representative of Vancouver 100 years ago may not reflect today's population. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Measurement bias\n",
    "**Measurement bias:** it occurs when choosing features that fail to correctly represent the problem, or when there are issues with the data collection. Fore example:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The measurement processes varies across groups. E.g. one group of workers is monitored more closely and thus more errors are observed in that group.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The quality of data varies across groups. E.g. women often self-report less pain than men and are therefore less likely to receive certain diagnoses\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The defined classification task or one of the features used is an oversimplification. E.g. We are designing a model to predict whether a student will be successful in college. We choose to predict the final GPA as metric of success. This, however, ignores other indicators of success."

    "Consider a crowd-sourcing project called [Street Bump](https://www.boston.gov/transportation/street-bump) aimed at helping improve neighbourhood streets in Boston from 2011 to 2014. Volunteers used a smartphone app, which captured GPS location and reported back to the city everytime the driver hit a pothole. The data was provided to governments so they could use the data to fix any road issues.\n",

   "source": [
    "The biases in the Street Bump project are primarily representation bias and measurement bias. Firstly, in terms of representativeness bias, the program relies on volunteers to participate and report data, and there is a high probability that this participation will not be evenly distributed across all neighborhoods. This would result in the system being more likely to receive more pothole reports from neighborhoods with high volunteer participation, leading to uneven street maintenance across neighborhoods; similarly, the program relies on a smartphone app as well as GPS. this means that it gets its data primarily from people who have smartphones. This excludes people who do not have access to a smartphone, which usually comes from people with low incomes or the elderly. As a result, affluent neighborhoods with more smartphone users are more likely to report a road issue, which can also lead to uneven street maintenance in different neighborhoods. Secondly, is measurement bias, which can result in different volunteers reporting different results for the same road problem due to differences in the type of vehicle the volunteers drive, their driving habits (including speed, etc.), and the sensitivity of their cell phones to detecting bumps.|"

    "Ethical A/B testing still requires all the ethical considerations of any experimental study, such as informed consent or possibility to opt out. A notorious case of a company failing to meet ethics requirement in A/B testing is the infamous Facebook \"social contagion experiment\", in which almost 700,000 users were showed, for a week, only positive or only negative content, to see how this variation impacted their online behaviour. The selected users were not informed and could not opt out. Furthermore, their emotional state was affected. Facebook defended itself by saying that Facebook's Data Use Policy warns users that Facebook “may use the information we receive about you…for internal operations, including troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, research and service improvement”. This defense was largely rejected by the scientific community, which still considered the study as unethical.

If you have reasons to believe that re-identification may be required, pseudonymization would be a better option to handle direct identifiers.

Because the information is very sensitive and students will most likely not want to share this information, they use the randomized polling protocol described in class. If 1000 students have been surveyed, and 300 of them responded \"yes\", what is the actual percentage of students who cheated in a final?"

    "- https://atlan.com/data-governance-mistakes/#what-is-data-governance\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, the issue of data governance is complex and multifaceted. A group of experts with a variety of experties is necessary to design and implement a robust data governance plan. Still, we can train ourselves to spot the most common mistakes when we see them. Take, for example, the following fictitional scenario (co-authored in collaboration with [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/))\n",

At their inception, they used to accumulate data in a vast digital repository known as the \"Data Lake.\" Initially, this seemed like a cost-effective solution to store all types of data, and they have not changed this strategy to this date. \n",

    "To increase agility, SleekTech's different divisions have significant autonomy over their data. This means that the same data may be recorded by different department using different standards and metrics. SleekTech also encourages a culture of openness.
